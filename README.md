#####What is OpenELEC?#####
Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center (OpenELEC) is a small Linux distribution built from scratch as a platform to turn your computer into an XBMC media center.

#####What is an unVM?#####
An unVM is different from a traditional VM in its ability to have direct I/O interaction with underlying physical hardware such as PCI and USB devices (think video/audio device, mouse, and keyboard).

#####Why run OpenELEC as an unVM on unRAID 6?#####
As an unVM, OpenELEC can now run on any unRAID 6 server that has capable hardware without needing to go through an atypical installation process or needing to dedicate a physical device for the purpose of an HTPC.  Now your server can also be your media player!

#####Other unVMs#####
Lime Technology is constantly investigating new and innovative ways to make use of unVMs.  Check out some of the other projects in the works including SteamOS and Ubuntu Desktop.
