####OpenELEC unVM####
Open Embedded Linux Entertainment Center (OpenELEC) is a small Linux distribution built from scratch as a platform to turn your computer into an XBMC media center.  An unVM is different from a traditional VM in its ability to have direct I/O interaction with underlying physical hardware such as PCI and USB devices (think video/audio device, mouse, and keyboard).  As an unVM, OpenELEC can now run on any unRAID 6 server that has capable hardware without needing to go through an atypical installation process or needing to dedicate a physical device for the purpose of an HTPC.  Now your server can also be your media player!

 - Processor / motherboard capable of Intel VT-d or AMD-Vi technology

 - PCIe GPU from either AMD or nVIDIA (others may work, but no support for on-board graphics)
